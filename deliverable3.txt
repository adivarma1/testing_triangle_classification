In order to make sure all the possible outcomes were tested, different values of sides were taken into consideration. 
At first we need to check if the sides actually form a triangle.
Then we need to make sure strings and other special characters might be entered as input.
Negative values are also a possible input that must be handled.
For the right triangle we need to make sure that if negative numbers are entered it must be an invalid triangle.
